Alpine linux based [Docker Hub container](https://hub.docker.com/r/masterandrey/docker-matplotlib/) 
with matplotlib, numpy and Python3.

Also I installed 'Comic Sans' font for xkcd style in matplotlib.

Matplotlib with dependencies builds about 20 minutes on Docker Hub so this repository
saves your time.

Example how to use it see in [Calendar for IoT](https://github.com/masterandrey/docker-iot-calendar).
